// //Function Parameters and Return Values: Create a function that takes two numbers as parameters, adds them together, and returns the result. Show how you can call this function and log the result.
// Explain & TIP: Functions can take inputs (parameters) and give back an output (return value). They're like personal assistants that do a specific task for you and report back with the results.
function add_numbers(number1, number2) {
    return number1 + number2;
}
//console.log("addition of two numbers is:", add_numbers(4,5))
//or
var sum = add_numbers(4, 5);
console.log("addition of two numbers is:", sum);
